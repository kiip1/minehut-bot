Since other developers may also find this handy, we decided to make it publicly available.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugin-library.17645/","version":"1.2.3","disabled":false,"file_name":"PluginLibrary.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1575623382192,"last_updated":1575623382192},{"_id":"5df428c0004abb016c862149","name":"ViaVersion","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Needed for ViaBackwards & ViaRewind","desc_extended":"\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaVersion.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576282304597,"last_updated":1576283675257},{"_id":"5df42c93e626aa0215b3ce06","name":"ViaBackwards","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Allow 1.9-1.14.4 Players To Connect","desc_extended":"Requires: ViaVersion\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaBackwards.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576283283017,"last_updated":1576283283017},{"_id":"5df42cb0004abb016c862185","name":"ViaRewind","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Allow 1.8-1.8.9 Players To Connect","desc_extended":"Requires: ViaVersion & ViaBackwards\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaRewind.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576283312153,"last_updated":1576283312153},{"_id":"5df8253e1444d301ad5f4a29","name":"EZRanksPro","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"The most customizable /rankup plugin","desc_extended":"EzRanksPro allows users to rank-up the easy way, with a very flexible and extremely customizable rank-up system built for server owners by server owners.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ezrankspro.10731/","version":"1.9.0","disabled":false,"file_name":"EzRanksPro.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576543550947,"last_updated":1576543550947},{"_id":"5dfc2fc5bafbee005362ea2a","name":"Custom Ore Generator","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Generate blocks as ores in your Minecraft world!","desc_extended":"With this plugin, you can generate every imaginable block that exists in Minecraft (except a few blocks, such as water and lava) as ore in your Minecraft world.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-ore-generator.64339/","version":"2019.12.15","disabled":false,"file_name":"CustomOreGenerator.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576808389140,"last_updated":1576808389140},{"_id":"5dfc30605db778004c4fa382","name":"MinecraftBut","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Simple Map Scenarios","desc_extended":"A Minecraft Plugin for youtubers such as BajanCandian, Skeppy, BadBoyHalo, A6D The youtubers will spawn in a small world with the option to apply multiple different senerarios\n\nhttps://github.com/HeathLoganCampbell/MinecraftBut","version":"1.7","disabled":false,"file_name":"MinecraftBut.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576808544077,"last_updated":1576808544077},{"_id":"5dfc32b6047d9a004c9f6782","name":"FastLeafDecay","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Speed up leaf decay in Minecraft","desc_extended":"https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/fastleafdecay","version":"1.0","disabled":false,"file_name":"FastLeafDecay.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809142961,"last_updated":1576809142961},{"_id":"5dfc345797a30e006166ed8d","name":"Ore Control","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Control the underground ore generation!","desc_extended":"https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ore-control.63621/","version":"2019.12.15","disabled":false,"file_name":"OreControl.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809559726,"last_updated":1576809559726},{"_id":"5dfc34b8ae9426004c67f8d5","name":"TownyFlight","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Towny-enabled Flight","desc_extended":"Finally, you can allow towny residents to fly while in their own towns, for free, from the lead developer of Towny.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/townyflight.50360/","version":"1.5.2","disabled":false,"file_name":"TownyFlight.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809656934,"last_updated":1576809656934},{"_id":"5e2a855ec8f64300a962bbba","name":"EpicGenders","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Because we all identify as something.","desc_extended":"Genders is a fabulous plugin that allows players to set their gender.

Since other developers may also find this handy, we decided to make it publicly available.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugin-library.17645/","version":"1.2.3","disabled":false,"file_name":"PluginLibrary.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1575623382192,"last_updated":1575623382192},{"_id":"5df428c0004abb016c862149","name":"ViaVersion","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Needed for ViaBackwards & ViaRewind","desc_extended":"\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaVersion.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576282304597,"last_updated":1576283675257},{"_id":"5df42c93e626aa0215b3ce06","name":"ViaBackwards","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Allow 1.9-1.14.4 Players To Connect","desc_extended":"Requires: ViaVersion\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaBackwards.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576283283017,"last_updated":1576283283017},{"_id":"5df42cb0004abb016c862185","name":"ViaRewind","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Allow 1.8-1.8.9 Players To Connect","desc_extended":"Requires: ViaVersion & ViaBackwards\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/","version":"LATEST","disabled":false,"file_name":"ViaRewind.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576283312153,"last_updated":1576283312153},{"_id":"5df8253e1444d301ad5f4a29","name":"EZRanksPro","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"The most customizable /rankup plugin","desc_extended":"EzRanksPro allows users to rank-up the easy way, with a very flexible and extremely customizable rank-up system built for server owners by server owners.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ezrankspro.10731/","version":"1.9.0","disabled":false,"file_name":"EzRanksPro.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576543550947,"last_updated":1576543550947},{"_id":"5dfc2fc5bafbee005362ea2a","name":"Custom Ore Generator","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Generate blocks as ores in your Minecraft world!","desc_extended":"With this plugin, you can generate every imaginable block that exists in Minecraft (except a few blocks, such as water and lava) as ore in your Minecraft world.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-ore-generator.64339/","version":"2019.12.15","disabled":false,"file_name":"CustomOreGenerator.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576808389140,"last_updated":1576808389140},{"_id":"5dfc30605db778004c4fa382","name":"MinecraftBut","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Simple Map Scenarios","desc_extended":"A Minecraft Plugin for youtubers such as BajanCandian, Skeppy, BadBoyHalo, A6D The youtubers will spawn in a small world with the option to apply multiple different senerarios\n\nhttps://github.com/HeathLoganCampbell/MinecraftBut","version":"1.7","disabled":false,"file_name":"MinecraftBut.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576808544077,"last_updated":1576808544077},{"_id":"5dfc32b6047d9a004c9f6782","name":"FastLeafDecay","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Speed up leaf decay in Minecraft","desc_extended":"https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/fastleafdecay","version":"1.0","disabled":false,"file_name":"FastLeafDecay.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809142961,"last_updated":1576809142961},{"_id":"5dfc345797a30e006166ed8d","name":"Ore Control","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Control the underground ore generation!","desc_extended":"https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ore-control.63621/","version":"2019.12.15","disabled":false,"file_name":"OreControl.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809559726,"last_updated":1576809559726},{"_id":"5dfc34b8ae9426004c67f8d5","name":"TownyFlight","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Towny-enabled Flight","desc_extended":"Finally, you can allow towny residents to fly while in their own towns, for free, from the lead developer of Towny.\n\nhttps://www.spigotmc.org/resources/townyflight.50360/","version":"1.5.2","disabled":false,"file_name":"TownyFlight.jar","config_file_name":"","__v":0,"created":1576809656934,"last_updated":1576809656934},{"_id":"5e2a855ec8f64300a962bbba","name":"EpicGenders","credits":0,"platform":"java","desc":"Because we all identify as something.","desc_extended":"Genders is a fabulous plugin that allows players to set their gender.
